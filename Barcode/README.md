# BarcodeGenerator
## EAN13 barcode generator written in C++
This very small piece of software can generate a barcode rectangle same as those printed on every pack you buy from the very near shop. 
Application is created from 2 c++ files and 1 c header file. 
Once you launch the application, it asks you to input a number, than it generates an svg image with the required configuration that a paypoint scanner can read it.
You can generate the barcode and test it with your mobile phone and BarcodeReader app.
